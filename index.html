    <p>
        I’m ,a student, author, and creative storyteller driven by curiosity and imagination from Bihar,India. From an early age, I developed a deep fascination with mysteries, history, and the unseen forces that shape human life. This fascination has evolved into my debut supernatural mystery novel, Swaraj Chaturvedi Adventures: The Cursed Hour, a story that blends folklore, suspense, and philosophy into an immersive experience for readers of all ages.Writing, for me, is not just about creating stories — it is about building worlds. I strive to craft narratives that feel alive, with richly layered characters, deep lore, and settings that draw readers into hidden dimensions of reality. My goal as an author is to inspire curiosity, provoke thought, and transport people into unforgettable adventures through words.

In addition to writing, I am also exploring interactive storytelling through gaming. My novel is being developed into a 3D adventure game, “Swaraj Chaturvedi: Echoes of the Cursed Hour,” which will allow players to step into the story’s world and experience its mysteries firsthand. This project reflects my belief that creativity should transcend boundaries — literature, gaming, and technology can work together to create powerful new experiences.Beyond my creative pursuits, I remain deeply committed to learning and growth. As a student, I value knowledge in every form — from academics to arts, from technology to culture. Every step I take as a learner strengthens my journey as a creator.At the heart of all my work lies a simple vision: to leave behind stories that outlive time. Whether through books, games, or future projects, I aim to inspire, engage, and connect with people across the world.

        <h3>The Cursed Hour</h3>
        <p>
Genre: Supernatural Mystery | Fantasy | Adventure <br>
Audience: Young Adults & Mystery Lovers<br>

🌑 Synopsis

In the forgotten town of Vritanagar, time itself is broken. A failed ritual has unleashed a curse that traps souls in a sinister loop — turning the innocent into wandering shadows of what they once were. At the heart of this mystery lies a castle that remembers everything, a clock that ticks in silence beneath the earth, and whispers of ancient entities that feed on forgotten hours.

Swaraj Chaturvedi, a boy from Darbhanga, stumbles into this web of secrets and becomes entangled in a battle that blurs the line between past and present, reality and illusion. Guided by cryptic warnings from the Archivist and haunted by the eerie Bell-Boy, Swaraj must uncover the truth before the cursed hour strikes again — and consumes everything he holds dear.

🖤 Behind the Story

The idea for The Cursed Hour was born from my fascination with folklore, forgotten towns, and the strange feeling that some places hold memories of their own. I wanted to capture that atmosphere and transform it into a story where time itself becomes the enemy.

This novel is the first in the Swaraj Chaturvedi Adventures series — a saga that will explore mysteries hidden across history, folklore, and imagination.
